# Remember Array Indices
Maintain positions in an array taking into account items being removed and added

### For Example:
If I start with an array [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with indices [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
            
An operation that removes 2 from the array would cause:  
Array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: [ 1, 3, 4, 5 ]  
Indices: [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]

And an operation that adds 2 back would make the array:  
Array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]  
Indices: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
